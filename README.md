# The yorick Project
randomly mashes the keyboard until Shakespeare happens, based upon [this theorem] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem). However a virtual version gives the user an army of monkeys and typewriters at almost no expense and with a lot less cleanup.

- Yorick.java provides an example of this theroem in which it will randomly output gibberish until it happens to say:
  "Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio"
  Please note this is really improbable so the program tends to not end unless you force it.

- VirtualMonkeys.java allows for users to provide input, giving them full control of the army of virtual monkeys.



version 1.1 now comes with better spelling of Yorick
