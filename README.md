# The yorick Project
randomly mashes the keyboard until Shakespeare happens, based upon [this theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem). However a virtual version gives the user an army of monkeys and typewriters at almost no expense and with a lot less cleanup.

- Yorick.java provides an example of this theroem in which it will randomly output gibberish until it happens to say:
  "Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio"
  Please note this is really improbable so the program tends to not end unless you force it.
- VirtualMonkeys.java allows for users to provide input, giving them full control of the army of virtual monkeys.
- HamletWriter.java reads the Hamlet.txt file and tries to replicate it by mashing on the keyboard. needless to say the odds of it working are *VERY* slim to none, keep both files in same folder.
- jar versions of the programs can be found int the JARs folder, these can be executed with the java -jar command


Hamlet.txt is a copy of the html version of hamlet available at http://shakespeare.mit.edu/
